# HackerRank Study Plan

## Strengthen Foundations

Arrays and Strings

- arrays, 2D arrays, common operations.
- rotating arrays, finding duplicates, subarray sum, etc.
- Strings: anagrams, palindrome checking, string manipulation.
- HackerRank Practice: Easy/Medium problems on arrays and strings.

Sorting & Searching Algorithms

- concepts: bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, binary search.
- time and space complexity for each algorithm.
- Practice implementing these from scratch.
- HackerRank Practice: Medium problems on sorting and searching.

Hashing & Dictionaries

- Understand hash maps and sets, and how they provide efficient lookup.
- Problems: frequency counts, two-sum, longest unique substring, etc.
- HackerRank Practice: Medium problems on hash maps and dictionaries.

Recap & Practice

- Review problems you struggled with.
- Practice mixed problems (arrays, strings, hash maps) on HackerRank.

## Intermediate Data Structures & Dynamic Programming

Focus: Recursion, Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming (DP)

Recursion & Backtracking:

- concepts: base cases, recursion trees, and backtracking.
- Practice problems: N-Queens, permutations, combinations, subsets.
- HackerRank Practice: Medium recursion/backtracking problems.

Dynamic Programming (DP) â€“ Introduction

- Revise: DP principles (top-down vs bottom-up), memoization.
- Classic problems: Fibonacci, coin change, knapsack.
- HackerRank Practice: Easy/Medium DP problems.

Advanced Dynamic Programming

- Problems: longest increasing subsequence, edit distance, DP on grids.
- Understand how to break problems into overlapping subproblems.
- HackerRank Practice: Medium/Hard DP problems.

Recap & Practice

- Review DP concepts.
- Solve 2-3 mixed medium-level problems from HackerRank.
