# Hacker Rank : Left Rotation

## PRoblem Description

Execute a left rotation operation on each of the array's element to the left. I will receive an integer that represents
the number of rotations to be made on the array.

I must return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

## Strategy to solve

My first approach to this is to use the split the original array strategy, and then append it to the left array.

There must be a javascript array method to split it, starting from the left, index 0.
