# Harcker Rank - New Year Chaos

## Problem description

The main issue is:

- A queue is defined by an array, which is a function argument.
- One must return total bribes each person on the queue have done, or the string "total caos".

## Solution and first approach

First attempt is to initialize a variable named bribes with zero.

After that, one should use two array iterations.
