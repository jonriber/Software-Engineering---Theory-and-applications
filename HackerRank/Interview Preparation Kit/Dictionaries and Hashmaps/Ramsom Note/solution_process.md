# Ramsom Note - Hacker Rank

What do I need to understand about this problem?

That I need to find a way to check if my ramsom note is a subset from the magazine message.

So, first thing is: what tools should I use on computer science logic and structure?

## Data structures

- Store the frequency of each word in the magazine in a data structure
- dictionary is useful for a quick lookup and check frequency number

## Loop for frequencies

Doing brute force way, incrementing each find of the initial array, on the correct dictionary key. Frequency will be 
the value of it.
