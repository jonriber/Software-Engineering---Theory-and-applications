# Readability

1. Avoid Novelty

- Familiar patterns are better than new or complex constructs every time

* **

2. Simplify Conditionals

- keep conditional checks short and direct

* **

3. Minimize nesting whenever is possible

- Avoid deeply nested logic by breaking into smaller functions

* **

4. Group logic into smaller groups

- Break long chains of functions or iterators into smaller steps

* **

5. Use naming conventions and better variable names

- Descriptive and unique names for variables

* **

6. Keep variables short-lived

- variable declarations must stick as close as possible to their usage

* **

7. Smaller functions

- keep functions small and focused on a single task

* **

8. avoid GOTOs

- use this only when absolutely necessary
