This document describes Docker functionalities and properties.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that enables containerization, including the creation and management of containers, images, and
volumes. It also provides capabilities to start, run, and stop containers effectively.

## What is a container?

Container is a piece of software or group of softwares that run independently of each other, with their own 
computational resources. They can connect to each other using well stablished connections and protocols.

correction:

A container encapsulates an application (or set of services) that runs in an isolated environment with its own
computational resources. Containers can still communicate with one another using standard networking protocols.
