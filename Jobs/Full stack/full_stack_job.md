# Full Stack Job Preparation Plan

Usually, Job description will give detailed information on the stack organization is using.

Full stack developers are generalists who can think on system design and archtecture.

Hands on multiple areas at once.

## First interview

Mock Interview Answers

1. Frontend (React/TypeScript)

- Q1: How do you manage global state in React?

The most common ways to manage global state are:
React Context API: For simple state management, use the useContext hook to pass state down the component tree without 
prop drilling.
Redux: If your application requires more complex state management, especially when state needs to be accessible across 
multiple components or needs middleware (e.g., for async actions with redux-thunk or redux-saga).
React Query: For managing server state, React Query can handle caching, synchronization, and background updates, ideal 
for REST APIs or GraphQL queries.

- Q2: Can you explain the difference between useState and useReducer?

useState: Used for local state in a component when the state logic is simple (e.g., toggles, form inputs). It’s easy 
to implement but doesn’t scale well for complex state transitions.
useReducer: A more powerful alternative to useState, especially for complex state logic that involves multiple state 
transitions or actions (like Redux). It uses a reducer function to manage state changes based on dispatched actions.

- Q3: How would you optimize performance in a React app?

Memoization: Use React.memo to avoid unnecessary re-renders for pure components and useMemo/useCallback to memoize 
expensive calculations or functions.
Lazy loading: Dynamically import components using React.lazy and Suspense to load code only when needed.
Code splitting: Use tools like Webpack to split the code into smaller bundles.
Avoiding unnecessary state updates: Ensure only the components that need to re-render are updated by carefully managing 
props and state.
Virtualization: For rendering large lists, use libraries like react-window to avoid rendering too many DOM nodes at once.

2. Backend (Python/Node.js)

- Q1: How do you design a REST API?

Define resources: Identify the main entities (e.g., users, products) and map them to endpoints.
HTTP methods: Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.
Versioning: Use versioning in the URL (e.g., /api/v1/resource) to avoid breaking changes in future updates.
Authentication/Authorization: Implement secure authentication (JWT, OAuth) and authorization.
Error handling: Ensure proper status codes (e.g., 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
Documentation: Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to document the API endpoints and request/response formats.

- Q2: What are some ways to handle concurrency in Python?

Asyncio: Use asyncio and await for asynchronous I/O-bound tasks to handle concurrent operations (e.g., fetching data 
from multiple APIs).
Threading: Use the threading module to run I/O-bound tasks concurrently.
Multiprocessing: For CPU-bound tasks, use the multiprocessing module to execute tasks in parallel across different 
processors.

- Q3: How do you manage security in an Express.js application?

Input validation: Use libraries like express-validator to sanitize user inputs.
Authentication: Use jsonwebtoken for JWT-based authentication or OAuth for third-party authentication.
CORS: Configure CORS policy to restrict access to specific domains.
Helmet.js: Use Helmet to set various HTTP headers for security.
Rate limiting: Use rate-limiting middleware (e.g., express-rate-limit) to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. System Design

- Q1: How would you design a scalable application for millions of users?

Load balancer: Distribute traffic evenly among multiple servers using a load balancer.
Microservices: Break down the application into loosely coupled services that can be scaled independently.
Caching: Use caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store frequently accessed data.
Database sharding: Split large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards).
Horizontal scaling: Add more servers to distribute the load as the user base grows.

- Q2: How would you handle real-time updates (like a chat app) in this application?

WebSockets: Use WebSocket connections to send real-time updates between the client and server.
Polling: If WebSockets aren't supported, use long-polling (repeated HTTP requests) to fetch real-time updates.
Server-Sent Events (SSE): For server-push notifications, SSE can push data from the server to the client over HTTP.

4. CI/CD & DevOps

- Q1: How would you set up a CI/CD pipeline for a full-stack app using Docker and Kubernetes?

Code versioning: Start by setting up a repository in GitHub or Azure DevOps for source control.
CI pipeline:
Use GitHub Actions/Jenkins to automatically trigger tests and builds when code is pushed to the repository.
Run unit and integration tests (e.g., using Jest or pytest).
Build Docker images for both frontend and backend services.
CD pipeline:
Deploy Docker images to a container registry (e.g., DockerHub or Azure Container Registry).
Use Kubernetes to deploy and scale the services in a cluster.
Implement health checks and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to ensure smooth deployments.
Automated rollback: Set up automated rollbacks in case of failure during deployment.

5. Behavioral

- Q1: Tell us about a time you had to mentor a junior developer.

Example: "In my last role, I mentored a junior developer who was new to React. I guided them through understanding 
hooks, helped them set up their local development environment, and reviewed their pull requests to provide feedback on 
code quality and best practices. This resulted in their growing confidence in managing tasks independently, and they 
eventually contributed to core components of our project."

- Q2: How do you approach architectural decisions in a project?

Example: "When making architectural decisions, I start by understanding the business requirements and constraints. 
I weigh options based on scalability, maintainability, and performance. I involve the team in discussions to get 
diverse perspectives, and we document the decision process for future reference. If there's uncertainty, I prefer 
building small proof-of-concept versions before committing to a solution."
