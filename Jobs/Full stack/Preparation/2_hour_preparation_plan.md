# Full-Stack Interview - 2 hour preparation plan

This plan should give you a quick hands-on review while covering the most important areas for the interview.

1. React & TypeScript Review (40 minutes)

Practice building a small app with React and TypeScript. Focus on:
Setting up components with props and state typed correctly.
Managing state with useState, useReducer, or Redux.
Implement a simple styled component using Tailwind CSS.

2. Backend Review (40 minutes)

Build a simple REST API using Python or Node.js:
Implement CRUD operations for a resource (e.g., users or products).
Set up a basic PostgreSQL or MongoDB database connection.
Add validation and error handling to the API.

3.System Design (20 minutes)

Design a simple system (e.g., e-commerce site):
Sketch out the architecture (API, microservices, database, caching).
Plan out how to scale the system for a large number of users.

4. DevOps & CI/CD (20 minutes)

Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions:
Create a workflow that builds a Docker image for your frontend and backend.
Practice deploying the Docker containers locally using Docker Compose.
