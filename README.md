# tech-interview-prep

Continuous updates for technical preparation. This repo includes personal notes about different software development
topics, system designs, tools, frameworks and languages.

Centralize resources: Everything related to interview prep will be in one place, making it easy to find and update.

Leverage Git features: You can easily track changes, collaborate, and even link specific topics to projects or notes.

Structure for scalability: If you need to add more topics later (e.g., algorithms, system design), itâ€™s straightforward to expand by adding new folders.
