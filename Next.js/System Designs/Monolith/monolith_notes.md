# Monolith 

Pros:

- simple
- no over-engineering
- single code base
- resource efficience on small project

Cons:

- 

## Issue of scaling

Process running on parallel are harder to balance and scale only a single part of your monolith.

For example, if an API route, store/get starts to get very busy and you need to desperately scale it to continue to 
respond every request.

That is where Microservices design comes into play, making your life easier to scale different parts of you code, all on 
demand.
